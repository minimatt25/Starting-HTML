            This is the beginning of describing what problems i have had when learning HTML, CSS, and JS. It has been a while since i last worked on this project, that is due to actual Uni projects i had to work on, but i aim to work on this at least once every 3 days for the next month.<br>
            Today i have been working on columns for the main page, so i can eventually get a menu system in place, that changes to an icon when it shrinks.<br>
            <br>
            I have found out about hover, so when my cursor hovers over a hyperlink it now changes my cursor to pointer, and fades in colours. Although what i can't figure out is how to center the link within the column i made.<br>
            I have now figured out that using "display: block;" instead of "display: flex;" works much better than before. The only problem i have left with the links is i can click them anywhere on the same line.
